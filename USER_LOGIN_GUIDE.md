## 🎯 First-Time Touch ID Setup

**After you can login with email/password, you can enable Touch ID for faster future logins.**

### On Mac (Touch ID):

1. **Login first** with email & password (Method 1)

2. **Click "Admin" button again**

3. **Click "🔐 Use Touch ID / Face ID"**

4. **You'll see**: _"No biometric credentials registered"_

5. **Follow the prompts**:
   - If not logged in, enter email/password
   - If already logged in, skip to next step

6. **Touch ID prompt appears** - Touch your fingerprint sensor

7. **Success!** You'll see: _"Successfully registered! Click again to login."_

8. **Next time**: Just use Touch ID - no password needed! ✅

### On iPhone/iPad (Face ID):

Same steps as Mac, but:
- You'll use **Face ID** instead of Touch ID
- Make sure you're using **Safari** browser
- Face ID must be enabled in Settings

### On Windows PC (Windows Hello):

If your PC has a fingerprint reader:
- Use **Chrome or Edge** browser
- Windows Hello must be set up
- Same steps as Mac

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Your Biometric Data is Safe:

✅ **Your fingerprint/face scan NEVER leaves your device**
- Stored in hardware security chip (Secure Enclave/TPM)
- Not accessible to websites or apps
- Not sent to our servers
- Apple/Google/Microsoft can't access it

✅ **What we store on the server:**
- Your public key (can't unlock anything)
- Your email address
- When you registered

❌ **What we DON'T store:**
- Your fingerprint or face scan
- Your private key

### Each Device is Separate:

- Register Touch ID on your **MacBook** → Works only on that MacBook
- Register Face ID on your **iPhone** → Works only on that iPhone
- Want both? Register on both devices! ✅

---

## 👥 Multiple Admins

**Good news:** Each admin has their own login!

### You (Main Admin):
- Login with YOUR email/password
- Or use Touch ID on YOUR devices

### Sarah (Approved Admin):
- Login with HER email/password
- Or use Face ID on HER devices

### John (Approved Admin):
- Login with HIS email/password
- Or use Touch ID on HIS devices

**Everyone's biometrics stay separate and private!** 🔐

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid email or password"
**Fix:** Double-check your email and password. Try resetting your password if needed.

### "Unauthorized: Not an admin account"
**Fix:** You need to request admin access first (Method 3). Or contact the main admin.

### "Touch ID / Face ID not available on this device"
**Fix:**
- Ensure Touch ID/Face ID is enabled in System Settings
- Use Safari (iPhone/Mac) or Chrome/Edge (Windows)
- Make sure you have at least one fingerprint/face registered

### "No biometric credentials registered"
**Fix:** This is expected! Follow the First-Time Setup steps above.

### "Authentication cancelled or not allowed"
**Fix:** You cancelled the Touch ID prompt. Just click the button again.

### Touch ID works on MacBook but not iPhone
**Fix:** This is normal! You need to register **separately** on each device:
- Register Touch ID on MacBook
- Register Face ID on iPhone
- Both will work independently
